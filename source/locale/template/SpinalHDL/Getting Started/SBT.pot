msgid "Now ``sbt`` shows a prompt. Let's start by doing Scala compilation. It will fetch dependencies so it can take time the first time:"

msgid "Actually you never need to just ``compile`` as it is done automatically when needed. This time was just to evacuate the long first build, and to get all ``sbt`` autocompletion features on the next commands."

msgid "So now, each time you save a source file, it will re-generate ``MyTopLevel.v``. To do this, it automatically compiles the source files and it performs lint checks. This way you can get errors printed on the terminal almost in real-time while you are editing the source files."

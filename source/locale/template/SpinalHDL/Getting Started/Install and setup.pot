msgid "Spinal is a Scala library so it requires setting up a Scala environment; there are many ways to do so. Also, it generates VHDL, Verilog or SystemVerilog, which can be used by many different tools. This section describes the supported way to install a *SpinalHDL description to Simulation* flow, but there can be many variations."

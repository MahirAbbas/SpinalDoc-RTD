msgid "``InOutWrapper`` is a tool which allows you to transform all ``master`` ``TriState``/``TriStateArray``/``ReadableOpenDrain`` bundles of a component into native ``inout(Analog(...))`` signals. It allows you to keep your hardware description free of any ``Analog``/``inout`` things, and then transform the toplevel to make it synthesis ready."

msgid "SpinalHDL provides two different abstractions for tristate signals. The ``TriState`` bundle and :ref:`section-analog_and_inout` signals. Both serve different purposes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/SpinalHDL/Libraries/IO/tristate.rst:18
msgid "TriState should be used for most purposes, especially within a design. The bundle contains an additional signal to carry the current direction."
msgstr ""

msgid "``Analog`` and ``inout`` should be used for drivers on the device boundary and in some other special cases. See the referenced documentation page for more details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/SpinalHDL/Libraries/IO/tristate.rst:21
msgid "As stated above, the recommended approach is to use ``TriState`` within a design. On the top-level the ``TriState`` bundle is then assigned to an analog inout to get the synthesis tools to infer the correct I/O driver. This can be done automatically done via the :ref:`InOutWrapper <section-analog_and_inout>` or manually if needed."

msgid "A master can use the ``read`` signal to read the outside value, the ``writeEnable`` to enable the output, and finally use ``write`` to set the value that is driven on the output."
